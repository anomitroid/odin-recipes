# odin-recipes
So, this is an Odin project. I guess im going to follow
the instrucions on the website and try to do most of the operations through terminal. So, yeah all the best!

So, i had written the stuff above before I started this.
Now, I have fininshed the entire process and made the repository from CLI commands. And, I'm pretty satisfied with the results.
This repo does look like other people's repo's I've seen.
Though the webpages themselves look hideous.
