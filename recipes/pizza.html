    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
    <p> The term pizza was first recorded in the year 997, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border with Campania.  Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating modern pizza in Naples.</p>
